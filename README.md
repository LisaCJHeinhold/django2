# Overview

I wanted to learn Django so I decided to create this simple Blog that uses Django and tailwind. This app is used in a virtual environment which can be entered using "source .env/Scripts/activate". The program can then be run by running "cd /blogProject" and then "python manage.py runserver".

# Web Pages

There are three pages, one shows the blog posts, another shows a single posts details and the other is the admin page were you create the blog posts. You have to have a login to access the admin page and add a post or delete/update any posts. You can access the login screen to the admin page by clicking login on the main page.

# Development Environment

For this project I used:
* Django
* Tailwind

# Useful Websites

* [Django Documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/)
* [Build a Django Blog](https://realpython.com/build-a-blog-from-scratch-django/)
* [Connect tailwind to django project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82OPcDVec_8&t=36s&ab_channel=SnipherDev)

# Future Work

* Create About page
* Give the blog posts meaning and a theme
* Update the styling
